\title{Calculate Lambda Between Two Vertex Sets (Naive Method)}
\usage{
calculate_lambda_between_naive(object, set1, set2)

\S4method{calculate_lambda_between_naive}{ECProb}(object, set1, set2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An ECProb object.}

\item{set1}{A character vector of vertex names.}

\item{set2}{A character vector of vertex names.}
}
\value{
The numeric lambda parameter.
}
\description{
Calculates the lambda parameter (expected edge count) between two
vertex sets using a direct, unoptimized summation.
}
\details{
The naive method has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n and m are
the sizes of the two sets. It is accurate but can be very slow for large sets.
Its primary purpose is for validation and speed-testing against optimized methods.
