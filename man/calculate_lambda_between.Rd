\title{Calculate Lambda Between Two Vertex Sets (Optimized Method)}
\usage{
calculate_lambda_between(object, set1, set2)

\S4method{calculate_lambda_between}{ECProb}(object, set1, set2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An ECProb object.}

\item{set1}{A character vector of vertex names.}

\item{set2}{A character vector of vertex names.}
}
\value{
The numeric lambda parameter.
}
\description{
Calculates the lambda parameter between two vertex sets using a
speed-optimized and accurate algorithm. This is the recommended method for accurate calculation.
}
\details{
This method has a time complexity of O(n*log(n) + m*log(m)) due to the
sorting of degree sequences, which is significantly faster than the O(n*m)
complexity of the naive method for large sets. It produces the exact same
result as the naive method.
