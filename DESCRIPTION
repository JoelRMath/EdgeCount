Description: Statistics based on edge counts in large and sparse graphs
    The underlying model is a random Random Graph with Given Expected Degrees (RGGED)
    The package provide functionality to
      - Estimate connectedness within or between vertex sets
      - Calculate associated p-values and other statistics
      - Perform enrichment analysis based on bipartite graphs of terms and their elements
    Functions are optimized for time complexity
